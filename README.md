# Crimean Tatar (Romania) - Language Documentation

This repository aims to document the Crimean Tatar language as spoken in Romania, focusing on its alphabet, phonetics, and phonological principles, based primarily on the work of Taner Murat and historical standardization discussions.

## Project Scope

The project covers the following aspects of the language:

*   **Alphabet:** The Latin alphabet used for the language.
*   **Phonetics:** Descriptions of the individual sounds associated with each letter.
*   **Phonology:** Rules governing sound combinations, vowel harmony, syllable structure, and phonetic changes.
*   **Grammar & Morphology:** (Placeholders for future content) Basic grammatical structures and word formation.
*   **History:** Context regarding the standardization of the alphabet in Romania.
*   **Tools:** Scripts or utilities related to the language, such as the provided syllabification script.
*   **References:** List of source materials used.

A key focus is understanding the distinction between "authentic" Tatar spoken and "academic" forms, particularly regarding loanwords and sounds not native to the authentic language.
